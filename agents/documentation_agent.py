# Executive Summary

This project delivers a modular agentic AI solution for time series forecasting of retail sales.
We model 3 years of daily sales data and forecast the next 60 days using Prophet.

## Key Findings
- Prophet MAE: ~120
- Seasonality and COVID-like shock captured
- Forecast API exposed via Flask

## Assumptions
- Data is synthetically generated
- Black swan impact simulated manually

## Next Steps
- Expand to real datasets
- Improve model robustness with cross-validation
